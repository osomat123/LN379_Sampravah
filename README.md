We have developed a Real Time Decision Support System that helps dam officials to take quick decisions in the time of an emergency. Our project uses Linear Regression to predict the water level in the dam reservoir and also the inflow of water. It also uses State of the Art YOLOv3 Deep Learning Object Detection Framework to detect and inform the number of people stuck in high risk areas in the event of imminent flooding.
